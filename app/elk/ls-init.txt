installing logstash via package. Locations of stuff:

configurations:

/etc/logstash/conf.d (I assume logstash config files go here)

log files:

/var/log/logstash

/var/lib/logstash ?? 

Binary: 
/opt/logstash/bin/logstash

(The configuration is I think an executable Ruby DSL. I think Logstash is written in JRuby)

The package I have is enormous and has a ton of packages. The ones I want are:

Inputs:

Beats (watches files) (check)
File (also watches files) check
http
log4j
pipe
rabbitmq
s3
sqs
stdin
syslog
tcp
udp

Pretty much everything you would want for log shippers.

Outputs:

CW
ES
graphite
nagios
s3
sns
sqs
stdout
tcp
udp

Also pretty much everything you'd want.

Filters:

anonymize, some parsers, etc. We'll see if I need anything.
